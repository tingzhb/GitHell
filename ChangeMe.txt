The Compass and the Star
In a small coastal town nestled between jagged cliffs and endless ocean, an old fisherman named Elias lived in solitude. Every morning, he would take his small boat to sea, casting his nets while humming an old tune passed down by his father.

One foggy morning, Elias found a peculiar object tangled in his net: a rusted brass compass with a cracked glass cover. When he tried to align it with the north, the needle refused to obey. Instead, it pointed steadily out to the open sea.

Curiosity stirred within him, and against his routine,
Elias stayed for a time, sharing his stories and learning theirs. When he finally felt the call to return home, the elder gifted him a star-shaped pendant. "Keep this close," she said, "and it will remind you of the light that guided you here."

Back in his small coastal town, Elias was a changed man. Though his days still revolved around the sea, his heart was lighter, his eyes keener to the beauty in every sunrise and wave.

And every now and then, on foggy mornings, he would glance at the star-shaped pendant and smile, wondering if the compass might find another soul to guide.
